    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Self-evaluation provides me with insight into how my leadership evolves with each iteration. In a sprint planning meeting, I employed another form of systems thinking to balance the allocation of resources and delivery objectives, similar to Tesla's approach with its production project at Gigafactory (Keppeler et al., 2021).</p>
    <p>I took the same route, as I recognized the problem with automation and mixed and matched manual and automated QA solutions within my group. Another realization occurred during the modeling of stakeholder pressure loops in engineering teams. As the diagram I created illustrates, overloading can damage morale and productivity. I halted the expansion of scope during a tense period to ensure the team's balance was not disrupted (Dabirian et al., 2023).</p>
    <p>These experiences highlighted the fact that, besides techniques, leadership requires a focus on emotions and foresight. The next quarter will be devoted to enhancing outside communication and gear, with a focus on providing team-oriented presentations without hesitation.</p>
