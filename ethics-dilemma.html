        <h1>Ethical Dilemma Response</h1>
        <p>
            During a group design project, one team member suggested manipulating test data to make results appear more favorable.
            As the team leader, I held a meeting to discuss the importance of integrity in engineering. We decided to report accurate results
            and improve our design instead. My decision was based on long-term credibility, respect for public safety, and alignment with
            professional standards.
