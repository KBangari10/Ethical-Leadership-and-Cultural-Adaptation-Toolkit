        <h1>Cultural Adaptation Reflection</h1>
        <p>
            Coming from India, I was used to hierarchical work environments. In the U.S., I observed flatter structures and open communication.
            Initially, this was challenging, but I adapted by participating in discussions and being proactive. I appreciate the focus on
            individual contribution and feedback, and I now feel more confident navigating diverse team dynamics.
