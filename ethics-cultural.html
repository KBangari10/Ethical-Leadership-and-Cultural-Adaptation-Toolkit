        <h2>Ethical Dilemma Response</h2>
        <p>
            The case in point is when I was hired as a team leader in a team that was
implementing software to a large organisation. I faced a significant challenge in identifying
the ethical decision that ought to be adopted. The Sprint in which we were working was not
going according to its schedule, and senior management was telling us that we had to
complete the Sprint on schedule at the cost of the quality measures

        <h2>Cultural Adaptation Reflection</h2>
        <p>
             The importance of stopping by team members, not just to check on
their progress, but also to check on their welfare and mood, is something I have also learned
to do.
